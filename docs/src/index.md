# SpatialBayesExtremes

The [*SpatialBayesExtremes*](https://github.com/MaiKing42/SpatialBayesExtremes.jl) package provides a collection of estimation methods for extreme events. Particularly, *SpatialBayesExtremes* implements:

* Probability-weighted moment estimation for Gumbel distribution, genralized extreme value distribution and generalized Pareto distribution
* Mean excess based Hill estimation and mean excess estimator for generalized Pareto distribution
* Maximum likelihood estimation for generalized extreme value distribution and generalized Pareto distribution
* Maximum likelihood estimation for regression models, where the coefficients of generalized extreme value distribution and generalized Pareto distribution, respectively, are assumed to be linearly varying in covariates, and all samples are independent
* Coming soon: Bayesian estimation for all extreme value models
